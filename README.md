## What is shimmy?

Shimmy is a app that makes you sit less and move more!

## Background 

According to the Harvard Medical school, spending too many hours sitting is hazardous to your health. From our own user research, we have found that people sit for an average of 6 hours per day. Habitual inactivity raises the risks for life-threatening diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. More than 5 million people around the world die from causes associated with inactivity. 

Researchers at UC San Diego School of Medicine have found that even light physical activity, including standing, can combat the effects of prolonged sitting. A lower risk for death was observed in participants that stood still for as little as 30 mins per day. The positive effects of standing were even stronger when participants moved around during the time they were standing. Given the research, breaking up long blocks of sitting with some light activity seems like a wise move for us all.

From our own user research, we have learned that most people either do not achieve their activity goals or are not consistent with achieving them in the long term. The common reasons for this include their busy schedule, a lack of motivation, and a disinterest in the fitness methods that are popular today.
